**Vehicle Speed Detection**


**Overview**

The "Vehicle Speed Detection" project uses a pre-trained MobileNet model to detect objects in a video and estimate the speed of moving vehicles. The application is built with OpenCV for computer vision tasks and Streamlit for the web interface. It allows users to upload a video file and visualize the detected objects along with their estimated speeds.

**Features**

Object Detection: Detect objects in video frames using a pre-trained MobileNet model.
Speed Estimation: Calculate the speed of detected vehicles based on the change in their positions across frames.
Interactive Web Interface: Upload video files and view results through a user-friendly web interface.
